# Python Data Analysis 
- Python data analytics project using Python in Jupiter Notebook
- Got to understand and implement the extensive Seaborn Python Library which is based upon Matplotlib
- This repository is a place to share my code for numerous data science projects.

## Got to sample various charts like Facet Grids based on this [csv](https://github.com/NikhilMeruva959/Python-Data-Analytics-Starter/blob/6f8c62b5500fc23c2cae36663f627c12684ff404/P4-Movie-Ratings.csv) about movies:

## Used Subplots() with Violinplots, KDE Plots, and much more:

## Explored the extensive ways of styling to tailor the charts to my specification:
